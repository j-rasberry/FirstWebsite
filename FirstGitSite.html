					<h2>My experience with Web design and development</h2>
					<div class="experience">
					<p>When I originally decided to learn how to code I was young. I remember when I was about 11 or 12. I logged into code academy and I tried to learn html and Java but, that was an utter failure becuase I had nobody there to guide me through and explain to me what I was doing. At the time I really didn't do much reseach. I thought code academy was all I needed to start coding a professional application. So in the end I had given up on the whole idea of becoming a programmer. Fast Forward about 6 years. When I was about 18 I decided to give coding another try. I first started to learn HTML and a bit of CSS. I remember the first website I created. It was a simple, It had a header a cat image in the center of the screen and a navigation bar to the side. Even though I hadn't really understood how it worked I was proud of it. That momment I realized I really want to start coding. 6 Months later, I wanted to find a college that provided a computer science degree that would fit my budget and the closest I could get was the web development and administration degree at the community college. My day of college in my php class I slowly started to spiril down the whole of obsession. I was flying through the course and loving every second of it. I was going above and beyond what the professor had asked of me and I tried to pick his brain every second I could. Long story short I have taken more classes and now So far I have learned to use a few languages. Hyper Text Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheet, PHP and, Java Script in web development. I have also attempted to learn C# and Java on my own by taking online classes and alot of trial and error. I have learned most of these languages taking the online courses here at Cleveland Community College.
