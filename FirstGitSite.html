					<h2>My experience with Web design and development</h2>
					<div class="experience">
					<p>When I originally decided to learn how to code I was quite young. I remember when I was about eleven or twelve. I logged into code academy to attempt learning HTML and Java but, that was an utter failure simply because I had nobody there to guide me or explain to me what I was doing. I thought working through the code academy course was all I needed to start coding at a professional level. So, in the end, I had given up on the whole idea of becoming a programmer. Knowing what I know now I know that Codeacademy was teaching me the fundamentals of coding in general. I wish I had someone to guide me through it at the time. It would have made my life so much more interesting. Fast Forward about six years. When I was about eighteen I decided to give coding another try. I first started to learn HTML and a bit of CSS. I remember the first website I created. It was simple, It had a header, a cat image in the center of the screen and, a navigation bar to the side. Even though I hadn't really understood how it worked I was proud of it. That moment I realized I really want to start coding. Six Months later, I was looking for a college that provided a computer science degree that would fit my budget. The closest I could get was the web development and administration degree at the Cleveland Community College. My class in college in a PHP course. After that day I slowly started to spiral down the rabbit hole of obsession. I flew through the course while loving every second of it. I was going above and beyond what the professor had asked of me and I tried to pick his brain every second I could. Long story short I have taken more classes and now So far I have learned to use a few languages. Hyper Text Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheet, PHP and, JavaScript in web development. I have also attempted to learn C# and Java on my own by taking online classes with a lot of trial and error.

		<h2>What I hope to learn in this course.</h2>
		<p>After all the time I have spent in class and online trying to learn how to code. There is still a ton of things I need to learn. In my most current Web Development class, I hope to learn more techniques to make a more well designed and responsive website. One thing I struggle with is the feeling that the websites I create are simply mediocre. The feeling that I have to improve greatly before I can call myself a developer at all. Whether it be a web developer or a software developer. I hope that by the end of this class I will feel a bit more comfortable calling myself a developer.</p>

		<h2>What I hope to learn in this course.</h2>
		<p>My future plans are actually quite simple. After graduating from college I hope to get a job that will utilize the skills I have learned or start my own business. E-commerce has become a massive industry in the last few years. I believe most companies would benefit from having a website that will allow customers to order from home and have it delivered, pick it up on site or, enable the customer to interact with customer service.</p>
